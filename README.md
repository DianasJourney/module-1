# Module 1: Introduction to Code Refactoring using HTML, CSS and Git

## Overview
**The client company "Horiseon" has requested that they want their webpage code to be restructured. They want to ensure that people with disabilities can access their website without any problem. What they want has been given:**

    - Codebase follows accessibility standards
    - Codebase does not change how the website functions
    - Viewing source code and finding there are HTML semantic elements
    - The HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
    - Image and icons have accessible 'alt' attributes
    - Heading attributes should fall in sequential order  
    - Fix a broken a link

## Results
**The following changes has been made to the codebase:**

- Replaced non HTML semantic elements with corresponding semantic elements that fit each property
- Removed/Consolidated the CSS section so it is more user accessible.
- The webpage loads correctly, there are no change in the website's functions
- All images and icon now has alt attributes
- Everything falls into sequential order
- The "broken" link for "Search Engine Optmization" is now fixed and redirects to the "Search Engine Optimzation" section.
- Product is now finished and everything is up to date.
